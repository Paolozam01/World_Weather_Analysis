# World_Weather_Analysis

For this analysis I was asked to create an input in which costumers would be able to add weather descriptions of their preferences which can be used to create a travle itinerary. First I created a data frame contaigning weather information about random places around the world, then I looked for a hotel within a 5000 meter radius from this locations, then I pointed out this hotels on a map and finaly I created a rout for the whole trip. This code can be used in order for costumers to have desirable weather in their vacations.
